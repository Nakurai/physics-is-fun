# Physics is fun!!

The goal of this repo is to implement the different steps of a physics engine as seen in this youtube video, by Zanzlanz [Coding a Physics Engine from scratch!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXrEX6j-Mws)

There is no other expectations than having fun and learning more about the [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) go game engine.

AI will be used. Blunders will be made. Can we reach the last level convincingly?
